Hi,  

*This is QA Automation Pre-Assessment, where i developed Test cases using C#, Selenium, NUnit, and ExtentReports for GoogleChrome browser.  

*This is a Page Object Model based Framework  

*Further possible enhancement can be made by implementing:  

	1- try-catch block in tests  
 
	2- creating Negetive test cases  
 
	3- creating methods for Dynamic webElements  
 
	4- Improve logic to read data from .json file or xml using ApachePOI  
 
	5- Add runner class suite to run all or selective test cases from one file  
 

===================Intruction to run Test Cases=============================  

1- Download "LawDepot_Assessment" from GitHub  

2- Extract file  

3- Open in Visual Studio 2022
